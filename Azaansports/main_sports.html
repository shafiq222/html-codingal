        <p>
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport played between two teams of 11 players. The objective is to score more runs than
        the opposing team by hitting a ball with a bat and running between wickets, or by hitting the ball to the boundary of
        the field. The game originated in England and is popular in many countries, especially those in the former British
        Empire.

        combination of running, passing, and kicking plays.
